# Mitch Paulus dotfiles

Always a work in progress.

## Programs I like to use:

* Vim: My first love.
* Kitty: default terminal since it can make use of the ligatures in
  Fira Code. Also has nice transparency.
* Compton: compositor for transparency, etc.
* i3: Tiling window manager.
* i3-blocks: Status bar for i3
* Fira Code: Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.
* Ranger: for file browsing/navigation.
* Zathura: PDF viewing.
* tmux: When i3 isn't possible, like when I'm working in WSL on Windows
* bash: default shell. Though looking into zsh.
* Firefox: It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen
  extension.
