As they say, progress not perfection.

## Using

* OS: Little of everything, one [Arch](https://archlinux.org/),
  one [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), two Windows.
  Looking into [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

* EDITOR: ~~Vim~~ [Neovim](https://neovim.io), I've made the switch.

* TERMINAL: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for the most part on Linux.
  [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) in WSL.

* SHELL: [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/). So much more pleasant to work in on a daily basis.
  ~~Bash, default shell. Though looking into zsh~~.

* BROWSER: Firefox, It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen extension.

* FONT: Fira Code, Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.

* PDF: Zathura, PDF viewing. Okular on Manjaro.

* COMPOSITOR: Compton, for transparency, etc.

* WM: Pretty much live in `tmux`, but have KDE plasma on one computer, i3 on another, and WSL on Windows at main work.

* FILE MANAGER: [`lf`](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
