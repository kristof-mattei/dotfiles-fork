Always a work in progress.

## Using

* OS: Little of everything, one Arch, one Manjaro, two Windows. Looking
  into NixOS.

* EDITOR: ~~Vim~~ Neovim, I've made the switch.

* TERMINAL: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for the
  most part on Linux. [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) in
  WSL.

* SHELL: `fish`. So much more pleasant to work in on a daily basis.
  ~~Bash, default shell. Though looking into zsh~~.

* BROWSER: Firefox, It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen
  extension.

* FONT: Fira Code, Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.

* PDF: Zathura, PDF viewing. Okular on Manjaro.

* COMPOSITOR: Compton, for transparency, etc.

* WM: i3, along with i3-blocks, Status bar for i3

* FILE MANAGER: `lf`

* OTHER: tmux, When i3 isn't possible, like when I'm working in WSL on Windows
