# Mitch Paulus dotfiles

Always a work in progress.

## Programs I like to use:

* EDITOR: ~~Vim~~Neovim, I've made the switch.
* TERMINAL: Alacritty for the most part. Sometimes Kitty, since it can
  make use of the ligatures in Fira Code. Also has nice transparency.
* SHELL: Bash, default shell. Though looking into zsh.
* BROWSER: Firefox, It's not Google Chrome and works pretty well with vim-vixen
  extension.
* FONT: Fira Code, Monospaced font with fancy programming ligatures.
* PDF: Zathura, PDF viewing.
* Compton, compositor for transparency, etc.
* i3-blocks, Status bar for i3
* Ranger, for file browsing/navigation.
* tmux, When i3 isn't possible, like when I'm working in WSL on Windows
