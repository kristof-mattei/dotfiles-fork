$$ \textrm{Serpentine} = \frac{\textrm{\# of rows}}{\textrm{Number of passes }}  $$

$$ \textrm{Serpentine} = \frac{\textrm{\# of circuits}}{\textrm{Number of tubes in face}}  $$

Appears most tubes are going to going to be 5/8" outer diameter. The
Temtrol coils have a 0.02" wall thickness by default.

- Range of face air velocities is 200-800 fpm
- Water velocity for individual circuit: 1 - 8 fps. Can get water being
  thrown off the coil above ~5 fps
