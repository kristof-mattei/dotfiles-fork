## Hyperref warning - Token not allowed in a PDF string

Solution: [Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10555/hyperref-warning-token-not-allowed-in-a-pdf-string)

Appears to normally be caused by having TeX commands in a location that
get turned into a hyperref link. For `elsarticle`s, the place it showed
up for me is in the `\author` command. Use `\texorpdfstring{tex
stuff}{pdf stuff - normally empty}` to get around the issue.

```tex
\author{Mitchell T. Paulus \texorpdfstring{\corref{cor1}\fnref{fn1}}{}}
```


## TeX Live

- Update `tlmgr`: `[sudo] tlmgr update --self`
- Update all packages: `[sudo] tlmgr update --all`
- List what would be updated: `[sudo] tlmgr update --list`
