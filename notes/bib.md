# Bib files

## Handling online resources

I've seen it done in several forms, here's one:

```bib
@Misc{UniMath,
    author = {Voevodsky, Vladimir and Ahrens, Benedikt and Grayson, Daniel and others},
    title = {{UniMath --- a computer-checked library of univalent mathematics}},
    url = {https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath},
    howpublished = { {available at \url{https://unimath.org} }
 }
```
