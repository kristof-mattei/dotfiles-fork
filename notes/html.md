From <https://www.leonieclaire.com/the-best-writing-tips/what-characters-are-allowed-in-html-id/>:

The HTML 4.01 spec states that ID tokens must begin with a letter (
[A-Za-z] ) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits (
[0-9]), hyphens ( – ), underscores ( _ ), colons ( : ), and periods ( .
). Classnames can contain any character, and they don’t have to start
with a letter to be valid.
