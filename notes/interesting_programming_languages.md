# Interesting programming languages

## [Mercury](https://www.mercurylang.org/about.html)

"Logic" Programming language. Functional

## [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/)

Janet is a functional and imperative programming language.

- Lisp like
- dynamic
- Good for embedding

## [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/)

- Functional, code is content addressed.

## [The next great functional language](https://www.slideshare.net/jdegoes/the-next-great-functional-programming-language)

Not really a language, but features that are pretty cool.

## [murex shell](https://murex.rocks/)

A better bash with types?

## [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

A functional programming language targeted at HTML frontends.

## [V](https://vlang.io/)

Meant to be simple and compile fast.

## [Kitten](https://kittenlang.org/)

Kitten is a statically typed, stack-based functional programming
language designed to be simple and fast. It is a concatenative language,
combining aspects of imperative and pure functional programming.

## [Lux](https://github.com/LuxLang/lux)

Functional, statically typed, compiles to JVM, JavaScript, Python, Lua, or Ruby

The language is mostly inspired by the following 3 languages:

- Clojure (syntax, overall look & feel)
- Haskell (functional programming)
- Standard ML (module system)

## [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/)

Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code.

## [F\*](http://www.fstar-lang.org/)

F\* (pronounced F star) is a general-purpose functional programming language with effects aimed at program verification.

## [Languages ranked by expressiveness](https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/)

Nice post trying to empirically determine which languages are more *expressive* than others.

## Hazel

Live functional programming environment featuring "typed holes". <https://hazel.org/>
