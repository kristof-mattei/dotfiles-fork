# Radiation

## Definitions

- Total Solar Irradiance (TSI): Solar power over all wavelengths per unit area on Earth's upper atmosphere
- Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI or *beam* radiation): Measured at Earth's surface perpendicular to sun.  DNI = TSI - (loss to atmospheric absorption and scattering).
- Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI or diffuse sky radiation): Radiation at surface from light scattered by the atmosphere.
- Diffuse: Modifier referring to the directional independence of the intensity associated with emitted reflected, or incident radiation.
