“Texas, Our Texas”
(Official State Song)

Texas, Our Texas!
All hail the mighty State!
Texas, Our Texas!
So wonderful and great!
Boldest and grandest,
Withstanding ev’ry test,
O, Empire wide and glorious,
You stand supremely blest,
God bless you Texas,
And keep you brave and strong,
That you may grow in power and worth,
throughout the ages long.
God bless you Texas,
And keep you brave and strong,
That you may grow in power and worth,
throughout the ages long.

“The Twelfth Man”
(Written by Lil Munnerlyn)

Texas Aggies down in Aggieland,
We’ve got Aggie Spirit to a man.
“Stand united!” That’s the Aggie theme,
We’re the 12th Man on the team.
When we’re down, the goin’s rough and tough,
We just grin and yell: “We’ve got the stuff
To fight together for the Aggie dream.”
We’re the 12th Man on that FIGHTIN’ AGGIE TEAM!


“The Aggie War Hymn”
(Words and Music by J.V. “Pinky” Wilson)

All hail to dear old Texas A&M
Rally around Maroon and White
Good luck to the dear old Texas Aggies
They are the boys who show the real old fight
That good old Aggie spirit thrills us
And makes us yell and yell and yell
So let’s fight for dear old Texas A&M
We’re goin’ to beat you all to
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Rough Tough! Real Stuff! Texas A&M

Good-bye to texas university
So long to the Orange and the White
Good luck to dear old Texas Aggies
They are the boys that show the real old fight
“The eyes of Texas are upon you…”
That is the song they sing so well (Sounds like hell)
So good-bye to texas university
We’re going to beat you all to
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Rough! Tough! Real Stuff! Texas A&M

“Saw Varsity’s Horns Off”
(Normally follows the singing of The Aggie War Hymn)

Saw Varsity’s horns off!
Saw Varsity’s horns off!
Saw Varsity’s horns off!
Short!

Varsity’s horns are sawed off!
Varsity’s horns are sawed off!
Varsity’s horns are sawed off!
Short!

“The Spirit of Aggieland”
(Words by Marvn H. Mimms; Music by Richard J. Dunn)

Some may boast of prowess bold
Of the schools they think so grand
But there’s a spirit can ne’er be told
It’s the Spirit of Aggieland.

(Chorus)
We are the Aggies – the Aggies are we
True to each other as Aggies can be
We’ve got to FIGHT boys
We’ve got to fight!
We’ve got to fight for Maroon and White
After they’ve boosted all the rest
They will come and join the best
For we are the Aggies – the Aggies are we
We’re from Texas AMC
