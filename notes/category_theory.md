## Category Theory for the Sciences (Spivak)

p15-16 Notation 2.1.2.9: Way overthought this. Essentially the entire
point of the notation is that we want to represent a single element as a
function. This way, you can compose with other functions, especially in
diagrammitic order. When he says $x: { :) } -> X$ *represents* $x$, he
really means it. Just think of it as the literal element $x$, just
wrapped up in a simple function that takes a singleton set to $x$.
