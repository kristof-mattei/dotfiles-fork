Troubleshooting zone that won't activate

1. Check main water pressure
2. Check controller power (not on battery backup)


1. Check output voltage at controller for zone.
   Should read 20-30 V.


2. Check valve resistance. Take out wires, set to resistance reading.
   Should be 20-60 ohms.

   Normal reading likely means mechanical failure
   Low reading indicates a short
   Open: Wire cut in the field or bad splice.

At the Valve:

1. Check for proper manual operation.
    You should be able to manually turn the valve 90Â° to open output.

2.  Check for power coming from the controller. Should get 20-30 V

3. Check the valve solenoid. Should get 20-60 ohm resistance.

4. Check for bad splice.
