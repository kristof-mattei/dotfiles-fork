# Divine Proportions

Love this text. Cool new way to see trig.

## Line:

A line $l\equiv<a:b:c>$ is a 3-proportion, enclosed in pointed brackets, with
the property that $a$ and $b$ are not zero.

## Null Line:

The line $l\equiv <a:b:c>$ is a null line precisely when

$$
a^2 + b^2 = 0
$$

## Point On Line:

The point $A\equiv [x,y]$ lies on the line $l\equiv<a:b:c>$, precisely
when

$$
ax + by + c = 0
$$

## Line through 2 points

$$
l = A_1 A_2 = < y_1 - y_2 : x_2 - x_1 : x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1  >
$$

## 3 Collinear Points

$$
x_1 y_2 - x_1 y_3 + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 = 0
$$

## Parallel Lines

$$
a_1 b_2 = a_2 b_1
$$

or the ratios of a's to b's are equal

$$
\frac{a_1 }{b_1}  =  \frac{a_2}{b_2}
$$

## Perpendicular Lines

$$
a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 = 0
$$
