## Variable Flow over Cooling Towers

From presentation on 2021-03-10: 2021-03-10_ashrae_variable_flow_over_cooling_towers.pdf

- Safer and easier to implement for cross flow cooling towers
  - Can generally turn down to 30% of design for cross flow
  - Only can turn down to 70% or so for counter flow.

- Can use nozzle cups for cross flow towers.
