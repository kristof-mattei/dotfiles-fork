## Variable Flow over Cooling Towers

From presentation on 2021-03-10: `2021-03-10_ashrae_variable_flow_over_cooling_towers.pdf`

- Safer and easier to implement for cross flow cooling towers
  - Can generally turn down to 30% of design for cross flow
  - Only can turn down to 70% or so for counter flow.

- Can use nozzle cups for cross flow towers.

## Rules of thumb for CFM

From [forum](http://www.refrigeration-engineer.com/forums/showthread.php?46112-Cooling-Tower-CFM-Per-Ton),
state 250 CFM/ton.
