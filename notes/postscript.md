# PostScript

## Converting to PDF

- `epstopdf`: Created by the TEX Users Group (TUG) and uses Perl and
  GhostScript. See [Link](https://tug.org/epstopdf/).
- `epspdf`: Turns out this is also in CTAN, [link](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/epspdf).

## Difference between plain PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

From
[link](http://computer-programming-forum.com/36-postscript/3f44b9bb6b8d7fe1.htm)
EPS is pretty much PostScript, but limitied to a single page. From the
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript),
it contains a "BoundingBox" DSC comment.
