# MS Word

- Refer to the same footnote or endnote more than once:
    - 'Insert cross-reference' -> Change type to Footnote. Will likely
      have to adjust the formatting to make the text supersript.

## Vertical alignment of inline images

This comes up when using images for equations. By default, the inline
figure is treated like any other character and the baseline is put to
the bottom.

The solution is to use the 'Font -> Advanced -> Position -> Lowered ->
Enter Points' dialog to shift the equation by a
certain number of points. Got this tip from [here](https://wordribbon.tips.net/T009827_Vertical_Alignment_of_an_Inline_Graphic.html)
