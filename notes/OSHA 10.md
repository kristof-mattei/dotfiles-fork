# Falls

Falls are the leading cause of death in construction.

6ft (1.8m) is the main threshold requiring safety measures.


Rails: Should be 42" +/- 3" high
Rails: 200lb within 2" of top edige
Wire rope should be flagged
Safety nets: < 30 ft drop from working surface
Safety nets: Multiple nets must be <6" apart.

Drop test: 400 lb bag of sand, 28-31 inches in diameter.

## FAS

- 1,800 lb max arresting force
- 6ft max free fall
- 5,000 lb anchor point
- 3.5" max deceleration distance
- strength for 2x potential energy of height (min 6ft)
- 5,000 lb strength for lanyards

- Self retracting lifelines and lanyards which automatically limit free fall shall limit to 2 ft, and minimum tensile load of 3,000 lbs
- Snap hooks and D rings must have tensile strength of 5,000 lb and proof tested to a minimal tensile load of 3600 lbs.


## Positioning Device Systems

- Cannot fall more than 2 ft
- should handle impact load of an employee's fall or 3,000 lbs, whatever is greater.

## Warning Line System

- Lowest point including sag > 34"
- Highest point < 39"
- Must be flagged

Stanchions - minimum tensile strength of 500 pounds

## Controlled Access Zone (CAZ)

- Between 6 and 25 feet away from unprotected edge
- must be defined by a control line erected 10-15 feet from the edge.
- Lines must be flagged at 6 ft intervals and have a minimum breaking strength of 200 lbs.

Covers: support at least 2x the maximum axle load of the largest vehicle to cross

## Falling Objects

- Toe boards: 3.5" wide

Fall protection plan: For when typical fall protection systems are not enough.

1. Statement of policy
2. Fall protection systems to be used
3. Implementation of the plan
4. Enforcement
5. Accident investigation
6. Changes to the plan

Fall training program standards: 29 CFR 1926.500-503

# Electricity

- 12% of young worker deaths in the workplace
- 5 workers electrocuted each week
- Stay at least 10 feet away from overhead wires during cleanup and other activities.
- If power line falls on vehicle, don't get out.
- Live parts of electric equipment operating at 50 Volts or more must be guarded against accidental contact
  - In it's own room
  - 8ft above the floor

- Covers and canopies: holes for wires should have bushings designed or smooth, well rounded surfaces.
- Power lines: Minimum of 10 ft distance recommended
- Wiring: flexible cords should be designed for hard or extra hard usage. Rating marked on cord every 24".
  - Designated by S at the beginning of the cord type. (though SJ is for Junior hard usage).
- Arc Flash: Must bigger deal than short circuit
  - Energy is referred to as "incident energy"

# Struck by Hazards

- Only falls rank higher and number one cause of death in the construction industry.
- 75% of incidents involve heavy equipment like trucks or cranes.
- Seat belts: 45% reduction in fatal injury in front seat of car, 60% by light truck occupants
- ITCP: Internal traffic control plan
- FHWA: Federal Highway Administration
- MUTCD: Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
- Channeling devices:
  - LCD: Longitudianl channelization devices
  - PCMS: Portable changeable message sign
  - TMA's: Truck/Trailer mounted attenuators

MOT (Maintenance of Traffic) 4 Areas:

1. Advanced warning areas
2. transition area
3. Activity area
4. Termination area

Flags are 24x24"

# PPE

Hard hat types:

Type 1: Helmets with a full brim, protect from blow to top of head.
Type 2: Brimless helmets with a peak extending forward from the crown. Protect from blow to top and side of head.
Class G: General service, limited voltage. Intended for protection against impact hazards. Used in mining, construction, and manufacturing. 2,200 Volt testing.
Class E: Utility service, high voltage. Used by electrical workers. 20,000 Volts.
Class C: Special service, no voltage protection. Designed for lightweight comfort and impact protection. Used where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object.

ANSI Z-89.1 is helmet standard.



## Nail Guns

37,000 emergency room visits.
- carpenters: 2 out of 5 were injured at some point in 4 years of training.
- keep hands 12" away from point of impact

## Abrasive Wheels

- Test using sound or ring test

## Caught In Between Hazards

Top 4 causes of construction fatalities:

1. Falls
2. Struck by
3. Caught in between
4. Electrocution

1926.1424 OSHA requires Work Area Control for swing radius hazards.

- Jacking equipment must be capable of supporting at least two and one-half times the load being lifted during jacking operations.
- 1926.502 Subpart M: Fall protection guidelines
- 5ft deep trench needs adequate protective systems.

Trench safety strategies:
  - sloping
  - shoring
  - benching
  - trench shield systems.

BBS = behavior based safety

Human performance snares
  - Time constraints
  - Interruptions or distractions
  - Multitasking
  - Overconfidence
  - Vague guidance
  - Overnight shift work
  - Peer pressure
  - Change
  - Physical environment
  - Mental stress

# PPE

- PPE standards often start from ANSI

- Provided at no cost to employee, except

- Steel toe shoes
- Prescription safety glasses
- Logging boots (29 CFR 1910.266(d)(1)(v)
- Items the employee has broken or lost

## Hearing Protection

If employees are exposed to noise >= 90 dBA averaged over an eight-hour period, requires hearing conservation program and regular testing.

## Foot Protection

- Electricity *conductive* shoes help protect against the build up of static electricity.
- Don't use foot powder when using *conductive* shoes. Provides insulation.

Electrical hazard rated shoes

- ASTM F2413-05
- CAN/CSA-Z195-M92, Section 4.3
- ASTM F1116-08

Backs are most injured body part, then hands.
