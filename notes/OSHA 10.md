Rails: Should be 42" +/- 3" high
Rails: 200lb within 2" of top edige
Wire rope should be flagged
Safety nets: < 30 ft drop from working surface
Safety nets: Multiple nets must be <6" apart.

Drop test: 400 lb bag of sand, 28-31 inches in diameter.

2. Leverage
3. Stability
4. Structural Integrity

- Wear of 1/3 the original diameter of outside individual wires with kinking, crushing, bird caging, or any other damage resulting in distortion of the rope structure
- Evidence of any heat damage from any cause
- In standing ropes, more than two broken wires in one lay in section beyond end connections or more than one broken wire at an end connection.
