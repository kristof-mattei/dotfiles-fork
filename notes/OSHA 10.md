Wire rope should be flagged
Safety nets: < 30 ft drop from working surface
Safety nets: Multiple nets must be <6" apart.

Drop test: 400 lb bag of sand, 28-31 inches in diameter.

# Module 4: Health Hazards in Construction

Focus on OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart D

## Silica

50 micrograms per cubic meter averaged over an 8 hour work shift.

Silicosis Types
- Acute silicosis: Develops after a few months or as long as 2 years following high concentration exposure.
- Chronic Silicosis: Usually occurs over 15-20 years

## Asbestos

4 Classes:
1. Class I: Most hazardous, removal of thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing asbestos containing materials.
2. Class IV: custodial activities in asbestos clean up

PEL: Permissible exposure limit, 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) of air, averaged over an 8 hour work shift.
Short term limit of 1 f/cc, averaged over 30 minutes.

- Employer must provide medical examinations for workers who for 30 or more days per year, engage in Class 1 through 3 work.
- Records must be kept for 30 years

## MDA - Methylenedianiline

- Light brown, crystalline solid with a faint amino-like odor.
- Used to coat exterior surfaces, such as concrete structure, pipes, and floors.
- PEL: 10 parts per billion as 8 hour weighted average, or short term of 100 ppb over 15 minute sampling period.
- Action level: 5 ppb over 8 hour TWA. Monitoring must then begin.

## Lead

- Toxic to reproductive systems
- Most commonly exposure via inhalation

Lead: Birth defects, metallic taste in the mouth, colic with sever abdominal pain


# Cranes

- 71 to 82 fatalities per year
- 30% of electrocutions involved cranes
- 11% accidents caused by mechanical failures

Why?
  - Instability
  - Lack of communication
  - Lack of training
  - Inadequate maintenance or inspection

4 basic principles

1. Center of gravity
2. Leverage
3. Stability
4. Structural Integrity

Sheaves: The boom hoisting sheave must have pitch diameters of no less than 15 times the nominal diameter of the rope used.

Wire rope rules

- Six randomly distributed broken wires in one lay or three broken wires in one strand in one lay
- Wear of 1/3 the original diameter of outside individual wires with kinking, crushing, bird caging, or any other damage resulting in distortion of the rope structure
- Evidence of any heat damage from any cause
- In standing ropes, more than two broken wires in one lay in section beyond end connections or more than one broken wire at an end connection.

A derrick is a lifting device composed at minimum of a one guyed mast, as in a gin pole, which may be articulated over a load by adjusting its guys

Lifting personnel. Don't exceed 50% of the capacity. Also "supports its own weight and five times the maximum load"

Master links and shackles: Support at least five times the maximum intended load.
Rotation resistant rope: Used in slings that support at least ten times the maximum intended load.
